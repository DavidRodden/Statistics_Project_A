*Part 1: Clearly state what you are investigating*

We are investigating Portland's Trail Blazers' scores and verifying whether their scores at home games are greater than those of away games.

$H_0: \mu_{home} = \mu_{away}$

$H_a: \mu_{home} > \mu_{away}$

*Part 2*

The group selected...

*Part 3: Collect your data!*

```{r}
home = sheet$home; away = sheet$away
home.mean = mean(home); away.mean = mean(away)
home.mean; away.mean
home.sd = sd(home); away.sd = sd(away)
home.sd; away.sd

```

The mean for home games is `r home.mean` while the away game mean is `r away.mean`.
As for standard deviation, the statistics are `r home.sd` and `r away.sd`, respectively.
